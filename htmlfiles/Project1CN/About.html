    <h1>AboutPage</h1>
    <p>Paradise Island is an island in the Bahamas formerly known as Hog Island. The island, with an area of 277 hectares (685 acres)[2] (2.8 km2/1.1 sq mi), is just off the shore of the city of Nassau, which is itself on the northern edge of the island of New Providence.

It is best known for the sprawling resort Atlantis, with its extensive water park rides, pools, beach, restaurants, walk-in aquarium, and casinos.[3][4][5]

Paradise Island is connected to New Providence by two bridges that cross Nassau Harbour. The first was built in 1966 by Resorts International, and the second in the late 1990s.

Recent history
Purchase by Huntington Hartford and development as a resort
Huntington Hartford, the A&P supermarket heir, arrived on Hog Island in 1959. Hartford bought Hog Island from Axel Wenner-Gren[6] in 1960-1961 and changed the name to Paradise Island in 1962. He hired the Palm Beach architect John Volk and built the Ocean Club, Cafe Martinique, Hurricane Hole, and the Golf Course, among other island landmarks. He also acquired and installed the Cloisters, a 14th-century French Augustinian monastery originally purchased in Montréjeau[7] and dismantled by William Randolph Hearst in the 1920s. He hired Gary Player to be the golf pro and Pancho Gonzales to be the tennis pro. Newsweek and Time magazines covered Paradise Island's 1962 opening. Hartford hired staff from Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc, Antibes (on the French Riviera) to work off season at the Ocean Club. He had the fireworks for the opening party flown in from the South of France. He had a flag and Paradise Beach was featured on Bahamian three-dollar notes in 1966 (introduced as a close equivalent to the Bahamian Pound, which was replaced at the rate of $1 = £7, so $3 = £21).

Paradise Island Airport
There was a small airstrip on the island from 1989 to 1999 to serve the resort. Before 1989 the airport was a seaplane base with a ramp for aircraft to leave the water. In 1989 a 910-metre (3,000 ft) runway was added to the airport.[8] The airport's codes were PID (IATA) and MYPI (ICAO). Paradise Island Airlines and Chalk's International Airlines were the airport's main tenants. US Airways Express also served the airport from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.

The STOL capable de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop operated by Paradise Island Airlines as well the Grumman G-73 Mallard amphibian aircraft flown by Chalk's International Airlines both served the airstrip, which closed in 1999. The airfield and runway have since been removed and replaced by an 18-hole luxury golf course surrounded by one of the island's wealthiest neighbourhoods. The area goes by the name "Ocean Club", with property prices as high as $40 million.

Development as a gambling resort
Hartford met James M. Crosby through Hartford's bodyguard Sy Alter. Alter met Crosby at the Colony Club in Palm Beach. Hartford obtained a gambling licence for Paradise Island and included Crosby as an extra investor. Crosby and Jack Davis then formed a company, Resorts International, to continue developing the island.[9][10]

Paradise Island was purchased in the 1980s for $79 million, then sold to Merv Griffin for $400 million. It was last sold for $125 million to Sol Kerzner.
